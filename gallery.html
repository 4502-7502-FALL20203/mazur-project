		<h1>Missouri River Relief photo gallery</h1>
		<p>This photo gallery shows a trip on the Missouri River hosted by Missouri River Relief, a nonprofit dedicated to cleaning up and educating people about the Missouri River. The trip was organized by Professor Sara Shipley Hiles and attended by a group of about 20 MU School of Journalism students and faculty. River Relief staff educated the group about the river and its inhabitants, and guest speaker Greg Olson spoke about Native American history along the river.</p>
