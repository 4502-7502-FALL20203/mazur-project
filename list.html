          <img src="img/irish.png" alt="A promotional poster of the Disney movie 'Luck of the Irish' depicts a white, brunette high school boy in a basketball uniform on a court. On the right, the same boy poses as a leprauchan with red hair.">

          <li>The Luck of the Irish</li>
        </div>
        <p>This was a favorite of the masses. While Luck of the Irish has some of the corniest jokes, its homage to a grossly underrated holiday is nothing less than fun.</p>

        <div class="list-picture">
          <img src="img/cloud9.png" alt="A promotional poster of the Disney movie 'Cloud 9' shows a boy and girl snowboarding a snowy mountain.">

        </div>
        <p>In my opinion, this was the end of the best Disney Channel Original Movies for me. Maybe I’m just a sucker for winter sports, but this one felt fun and flirty without trying too hard. Unfortunately, Disney Channel went downhill after this.</p>

        <div class="list-picture">
          <img src="img/princess.png" alt="A promotional poster of the Disney movie 'Princess Protection Program' shows Selena Gomex and Demi Lovato sitting on a pier in front of a lake, surrounded by fishing supplies. Gomez wears plain clothes, while Lovato wears a crown and frilly yellow ballgown dress.">

          <div class="list-heads">
        <li>Princess Protection Program</li>
      </div>
      <p>I remember country gal meets princess being the most memorable, mind-blowing trope for us as children. And to be honest, the dynamic duo of young Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato will still knock you out.

      <div class="list-picture">
        <img src="img/geek-charming.png" alt="A promotional poster of the Disney movie 'Geek Charming' shows a white, brunette girl holding a shrunken white, brunette boy in her hand. The boy is on a computer and surrounded by posters that read 'Vote Dylan for Blossom Queen'">
      </div>

      <div class="list-heads">
        <li>Geek Charming</li>
      </div>
      <p>This one’s the ultimate cute watch. Not much more to say, just Sarah Hyland playing the best mean-girl-to-loving-main-character ever and great representation for nerd guys everywhere.</p>

      <div class="list-picture">
      <img src="img/kim-possible.png" alt="A promotional poster of the Disney movie 'Kim Possible Movie: So The Drama' shows cartoon characters Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable in fighting poses.">
    </div>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <li>Kim Possible Movie: So The Drama</li>
    </div>
    <p>2000s kids know that this Kim Possible movie is superior. While live-action movies are good and all, the animated fights in this one just can’t be beat. Topped by the end of the will-they-or-won’t-they between Kim and Ron and the car flying off (inexplicably) into the sunset, this will still bring back all the nostalgia.</p>

    <div class="list-picture">
      <img src="img/halloweentown.png" alt="A promotional poster of the Disney movie 'Halloweentown' shows three white, brunette children above a giant pumpkin and a purple building labelled 'City Hall.' The children look up at aa white, blond womaan flying a broomstick against a purple night sky.">
    </div>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <li>The Halloweentoown series</li>
    </div>
    <p>These movies not only defined a generation, but a whole holiday. Halloweentown is still the ultimate cozy October watch two decades later. The atmosphere, the iconic music, the corny jokes, the old-fashioned monster costumes — just the opening lines will have you lighting pumpkin spice scented candles and snuggling up for a rewatch.</p>

    <div class="list-picture">
      <img src="img/let-it-shine.png" alt="A promotional posoter of the Disney movie 'Let It Shine' shows a Black teenager boy in the center singing into a microphone. Behind him stands another Black teen boy and a Black girl who is singing.">
    </div>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <li>Let It Shine</li>
    </div>
    <p>Let It Shine introduced the world to Tyler James’ Williams talents in the most incredible manner. Arguably one of the most original storylines put out by Disney, this one was and still is an instant classic.</p>

    <div class="list-picture">
      <img src="img/hsm.png" alt="A promotional pooster of the Disney movie 'High Schoool Musical' shows six teenagers jumping in the air on a stage, with red curtains behind them.">
    </div>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <li>High School Musical series</li>
  </div>
  </p>Do I need to say more? If you don’t still cry when the cast of High School Musical jumps for the last time in their graduation robes, you simply don’t have a heart.</p>

    <div class ="list-picture">
      <img src="img/starstruck.png" alt="A promotional pooster of the Disney movie 'Starstruck' shows a white teenage boy and girl. They stand in front of a poster of the boy's face, on which the girl has drawn a mustache and beard.">
    </div>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <li>Starstruck</li>
    </div>
    <p>Another meet-cute to die for. Although the “girl doesn’t care about male celebrity” trope has now been arguably overplayed, chances are this was most kids’ introduction to the storyline. Plus, this one has surprisingly good music that will still have you bopping your head.</p>

    <div class="list-picture">
      <img src="img/lemonade-mouth.png" alt="A promotional pooster of the Disney movie 'Lemonade Mouth' shows five teenaagers in black and white playing instruments and performing. They staand in front of a huge, stylized picture of a lemon.">
      </div>

      <div class="list-heads">
       <li>Lemonade Mouth</li>
     </div>
     <p>Lemonade Mouth is universally acknowledged as the cream of the crop. Despite the acting being questionable, every scene serves top-tier drama and music. Plus, Wen’s rap solo is simply irreplicable.</p>
