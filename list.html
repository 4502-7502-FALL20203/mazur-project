      <h1>10 Disney Channel Original Movies you'll still enjoy as an adult</h1>
      <p>If you grew up in the early 2000s, you know that Disney no longer holds as much pull as it once did — but some movies are still gems. Read on and see if you agree with my top 10 DCOMs that I would still gladly rewatch today.</p>

          <h2>10. The Luck of the Irish</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This was a favorite of the masses. While Luck of the Irish has some of the corniest jokes, its homage to a grossly underrated holiday is nothing less than fun.</p>

        <h2>9. Cloud 9</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In my opinion, this was the end of the best Disney Channel Original Movies for me. Maybe I’m just a sucker for winter sports, but this one felt fun and flirty without trying too hard. Unfortunately, Disney Channel went downhill after this.</p>

        <h2>8. Princess Protection Program</h2>
      </div>
      <p>I remember country gal meets princess being the most memorable, mind-blowing trope for us as children. And to be honest, the dynamic duo of young Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato will still knock you out.

        <h2>7. Geek Charming</h2>
      </div>
      <p>This one’s the ultimate cute watch. Not much more to say, just Sarah Hyland playing the best mean-girl-to-loving-main-character ever and great representation for nerd guys everywhere.</p>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <h2>6. Kim Possible Movie: So The Drama</h2>
    </div>
    <p>2000s kids know that this Kim Possible movie is superior. While live-action movies are good and all, the animated fights in this one just can’t be beat. Topped by the end of the will-they-or-won’t-they between Kim and Ron and the car flying off (inexplicably) into the sunset, this will still bring back all the nostalgia.</p>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <h2>5. The Halloweentoown series</h2>
    </div>
    <p>These movies not only defined a generation, but a whole holiday. Halloweentown is still the ultimate cozy October watch two decades later. The atmosphere, the iconic music, the corny jokes, the old-fashioned monster costumes — just the opening lines will have you lighting pumpkin spice scented candles and snuggling up for a rewatch.</p>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <h2>4. Let It Shine</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Let It Shine introduced the world to Tyler James’ Williams talents in the most incredible manner. Arguably one of the most original storylines put out by Disney, this one was and still is an instant classic.</p>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <h2>3. High School Musical series</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Do I need to say more? If you don’t still cry when the cast of High School Musical jumps for the last time in their graduation robes, you simply don’t have a heart.</p>

    <div class ="list-picture">
      <img src="img/starstruck.jpg" alt="A promotional pooster of the Disney movie 'Starstruck' shows a white teenage boy and girl. They stand back to back in front of a huge star.">

    </div>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <h2>2. Starstruck</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Another meet-cute to die for. Although the “girl doesn’t care about male celebrity” trope has now been arguably overplayed, chances are this was most kids’ introduction to the storyline. Plus, this one has surprisingly good music that will still have you bopping your head.</p>

    <div class="list-picture">

        </div>

      <div class="list-heads">
       <h2>1. Lemonade Mouth</h2>
     </div>
     <p>Lemonade Mouth is universally acknowledged as the cream of the crop. Despite the acting being questionable, every scene serves top-tier drama and music. Plus, Wen’s rap solo is simply irreplicable.</p>
